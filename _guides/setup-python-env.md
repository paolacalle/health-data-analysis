Because this script is written in Python, youâ€™ll want to set up a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean and organized.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the repo
cd health-data-analysis

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate the environment
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
