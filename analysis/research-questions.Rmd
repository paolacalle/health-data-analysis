# Reserach questions

- Did I work out that day? (Yes/No) vs Mean Heart Rate (vs Resting Heart Rate)
- Type of workout vs mean heart rate per day. 
- Year vs mean heart rate.
- Year vs number of completed workouts.

# Did I work out that day?  (Yes/No) vs Mean Heart Rate (vs Resting Heart Rate)


# Workout Type vs Mean HR per Day

- Assign a priority/intensity score per workout type.


# Number of Times Workout vs Mean HR per Day


# Year vs Mean Heart Rate

- Compare with yearly workout totals — is HR going down as workouts go up?
- Factor in average body mass or BMI, if available — HR might correlate.

# Year vs Number of Completed Workouts

- By season/month (do you work out more in summer?)
- Add a “consistency score”: How many weeks did you work out at least once?

# Workout Frequency vs. Weight/BMI Changes

- Does more frequent working out actually correlate with lower body mass/BMI over time?
- Could be structured as a weekly or monthly trend.

# Day and Heart Rate

- Split workout frequency or HR trends by day of week.

# Time of Day vs Workout Type

- Do I tend to do cardio in the morning and strength in the evening?
